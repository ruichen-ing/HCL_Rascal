# DSL Design 2022 - Assignment 1 - Group 6
This is a Rascal project implementing a Hardware Configuration Language. 

We are Group 6 in the course 2IMP20 Domain Specific Language Design. The group members are Ruichen Hu and Tingyuan Zhang.

In this project, we define a DSL for hardware configuration. The file `Check.rsc` is implemented on the basis of the requirements in the provided pdf file. As for the solutions for the further ambiguities, please read the comments above each function in  `Check.rsc`.

We also provide 9 test programs in the folder `examples`, one of which is the correct .hcl file showing which cases are accepted by our DSL, and the other 8 files represent different problematic scenarios. You can run the `main()`function in the `Plugin.rsc` to check whether our implementation fulfills the requirements. The content and target of each test program is described in the comments of  `Plugin.rsc`.
